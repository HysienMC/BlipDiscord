README: How to Run the Discord Bot
Welcome to the Blip Bot! Follow the steps below to set up and run the bot on your server.

Prerequisites
Make sure Python 3.8 or higher is installed.

Download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Obtain your Discord Bot Token from the Discord Developer Portal:
https://discord.com/developers/applications

Install the required Python libraries by running:

[pip install discord.py]

Configuration Steps
Download the Bot Code

Clone or download the bot’s files to your computer.
Set Up Announcement Channel

Open status.py and locate the line that says:
channel_id = 123456789012345678
Replace 123456789012345678 with the Channel ID of the channel where you want the bot to send its status messages (like "All systems operational").
Set Up Test Command Channel

Choose a text channel where you will test commands. Ensure the bot has permissions in this channel to:
Read Messages
Send Messages
Embed Links (if using rich embeds)
Provide the Bot Token

In Blip.py, find the line:
python
Copy code
await bot.start('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN')
Replace 'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN' with your actual bot token.
Running the Bot
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the bot’s code is saved.
Start the bot by running:

python Blip.py
If everything is set up correctly, the bot will:
Announce its status in the Announcement Channel.
Respond to commands in the Test Command Channel.
Troubleshooting
Bot is not coming online:

Double-check the token in Blip.py.
Ensure your Python version is compatible.
Bot is not sending messages:

Make sure the bot has Send Messages and Embed Links permissions in the channels you’ve configured.
Still having issues?

Restart the bot using the restart logic already in Blip.py.
Check the logs for errors.
Happy Botting!
